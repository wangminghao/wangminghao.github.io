  from AKOUSMATIKOI: (HEARERS) AKOUSMA a thing heard
  <br>
  <br>
  — the noise which we hear without seeing what is causing it
  <br>
  <br>
  — a voice whose source one cannot see, a voice whose origin cannot be identified
  <br>
  <br>
  Philosophical origin: The Acousmatics were Pythagoras’ disciples who, concealed by a curtain, followed his teaching for five years without being able to see him directly followed by a period of silence before being admitted to Pythagoras' inner circle as mathêmatikoi (learned).
