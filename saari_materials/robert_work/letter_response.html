  Everything is being.
  <br>
  Everything is being read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senses as sense.
  <br>
  <br>
  Is to read to mean meaning?
  <br>
  <br>
  As with within, a field of wheat that would feed half a country
  <br>
  blown by waves of wind.
  <br>
  A car so far away only its motion is seen are words
  <br>
  the way sounds don’t exist without hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rereading what the rereading makes never the same
  <br>
  and settling on each wheat flower from here to flowing horizon.
  <br>
  <br>
  We want to deal with decomposition, so a fly full speed ahead
  <br>
  head-first hits the glass, uprights a badly injured mosquito as
  <br>
  a barn swallow crosses an inch above the wheat field.
  <br>
  <br>
  An audience assembled to do what they need to do when they are not an audience
  <br>
  as what is taking place a focused performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stages change. What changes stages. What changes stages if not staged change?
  <br>
  <br>
  Words like I stroll. I, like words, stroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Action is librarian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Read by doing. Be by reading below. Do by being horizon line above.
  <br>
  <br>
  Audience as cytoplasma’s cytoplasma — the nucleus nowhere, which is to say “distributed.”
  <br>
  <br>
  If you realize the view is the view, the viewer dissolves. If there is no realization, the viewed is
  <br>
  the viewer and the viewer is the view without realizing that this is the case as we deaden.
  <br>
  <br>
  The funcxtion of the audience is to resist non-transformation by the limitations of the performance.
  <br>
  It’s tense. Needy. Helpless. Helpfully hopelessly hopefully helpful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Our job is our job. Job job. To. Mutual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Built mother. Imply is the only complete wovwuvwaveveer un-overdone.
