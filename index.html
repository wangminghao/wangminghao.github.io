      <h1>Hyperspace Dance</h1>
      <div id="intro">
        My name is Annie Wang and Hyperspace Dance is my choreography project.  My goal is to create work that transforms the space that it inhabits.  I am inspired by storytelling - the constant progression from one state to another.  Transition, process, struggle, reaction, the moment of decision, the act of remaining, the stillness in a moment that is about to change.  All these are the components of stories, whether they come from the human world, from nature, from mathematics, or from dreams.  I believe that at its best, storytelling through the physicality of dance creates an intimate, charged space that goes beyond its own boundaries and enfolds the audience.
